# Mex space

A monorepo for sharing packages across different applications (Desktop, web, etc)

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
